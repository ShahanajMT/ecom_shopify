# #   # assets:
# #   #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
# #   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

# #   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# #   # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

# #   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
# #   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

# #   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
# #   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# #   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# #   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# #   # example:
# #   # fonts:
# #   #   - family: Schyler
# #   #     fonts:
# #   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
# #   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
# #   #         style: italic
# #   #   - family: Trajan Pro
# #   #     fonts:
# #   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
# #   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
